# To setup you pi pico and use it with program it with micropython, you can find
# various instructions on the internet. Like
# https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/2


# This library is here to help you get quickly familiar with the asynch framework.
# This allows for much more complex projects (ie lots of sensors, actuators, led strips
# or even projects control or MQTT integration to be done simply with minimal processing.
#
# 1) in order to run any demo, you need to copy the required files from the main folder (the library folder)
#    onto the pico
#
# 2) most demos require some hardware setup, if you change how things are connected, make sure you update the code
#
# 3) Enjoy!!
