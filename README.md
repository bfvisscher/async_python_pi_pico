Library to program the Raspberry PI PICO using an async model.  

The goal is to bew able to run multiple light strips, leds, displays, motors, ranging etc. without creating hugely complex programs but through simple isolated pieces of code that remain self explenatory. All this while not creating a huge burden on the CPU!
