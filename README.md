Library to program the Raspberry PI PICO using an async model.  

The initial goal is to run multiple light strips with high refresh (60hz) with a range of patterns. Soon this extended and now includes leds, displays, motors, ranging etc. without creating hugely complex programs but through simple isolated pieces of code that remain self explenatory. All this while not creating a huge burden on the CPU!
